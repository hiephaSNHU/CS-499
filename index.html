  <p>
    During my time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, 
    I have learned how to think like a software engineer. Over the past two years, 
    I gained strong skills in programming, design, algorithms, and databases. 
    My work on the Android Inventory Management App shows how I can design useful, 
    secure, and easy-to-use applications. These skills support my career goal of 
    becoming a Software Engineer or Production Systems Engineer in the manufacturing 
    and automation field.
  </p>

  <h2>Growth as a Computer Scientist</h2>
  <p>
    When I started this program, I focused mostly on writing code. 
    As I learned more, I realized that good software is not only about code 
    but also about how the system is planned, tested, and improved. 
    Courses such as Mobile Architecture and Programming, Advanced Programming Concepts, 
    and Secure Coding helped me learn how to build strong, reliable, and safe applications. 
    I also learned to think about security and user privacy whenever I design or test a program.
  </p>

  <h2>Teamwork and Communication</h2>
  <p>
    I have learned how to explain technical work clearly to others. 
    Through my code review video and written reports, I practiced describing how my programs work 
    and why I made certain design choices. This helped me improve my writing and presentation skills. 
    I am now more confident working with teammates and explaining my ideas in a way that both 
    technical and non-technical people can understand.
  </p>

  <h2>Software Design and Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    In my first enhancement, I improved the Inventory App’s layout by using RecyclerView 
    and adding a Settings screen. These updates made the app easier to use and more organized. 
    I also added input checks to prevent errors. The project taught me how to structure my code, 
    keep files organized, and make the design more professional. 
    I learned that clean design and small details make a big difference in user experience.
  </p>

  <h2>Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
  <p>
    In my second enhancement, I made the app faster and more efficient. 
    I added search and filter features, used caching to speed up repeated actions, 
    and created batch updates so the app could handle large amounts of data easily. 
    I also used indexing to make searches faster. These updates helped me understand how algorithms 
    affect performance and how to choose the right data structure for the job.
  </p>

  <h2>Databases and Data Management</h2>
  <p>
    For the final enhancement, I focused on improving the database. 
    I created a transactions table and added SQL triggers to record every change made to the inventory. 
    I also built a history page so users can view updates and exports easily. 
    This helped me practice writing clear SQL queries and managing data safely. 
    It showed me how to keep records organized and make information easy to retrieve.
  </p>

  <h2>Security and Professional Practice</h2>
  <p>
    Security was an important part of every update I made. 
    I added input checks, error handling, and secure data storage to keep user information safe. 
    I also learned how to manage permissions when saving files and exporting data. 
    These lessons will help me write safe and dependable software in my future career.
  </p>

  <h2>Career Goals</h2>
  <p>
    My studies and projects have prepared me for a career in software engineering. 
    I plan to keep learning about cloud systems and artificial intelligence because they are 
    important in modern production and automation. In the future, I want to build systems 
    that improve quality, tracking, and efficiency in manufacturing.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This portfolio shows how I have grown as a computer science student and as a future engineer. 
    Each project in this portfolio highlights a different skill, from software design 
    to database management. Together, they show that I can analyze code, find ways to improve it, 
    and build complete solutions that work well in real situations. 
    I am ready to use these skills in my career and continue learning to become a better engineer.
